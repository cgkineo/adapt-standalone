# adapt-standalone
A wrapper for serving Adapt courses from the local filesystem on Windows.

### Make a new standalone course:

1. Replace data/www/course/\* with your built Adapt course.
1. (optional) delete the folder data/buildassets/. This folder contains a .vbs file which is the kind of file likely to make IT people nervous/trigger attachment blockers etc. and is only needed if you need to recreate Launch Course.exe
